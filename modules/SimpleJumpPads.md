SimpleJumpPads enables the classic MCBall jump pads in a map. Each jump pad should be a pressure plate directly on top of a redstone block. There are three types of pressure plate options:
- Stone pressure plate: vertical launch at 1.1 blocks per second (approximately 7 blocks high).
- Iron pressure plate: vertical launch at 1.4 blocks per second (approximately 10.7 blocks high).
- Gold pressure plate: launches the player in the direction they are looking at a speed of ~3.5 blocks per second with a vertical speed of 1.4 blocks per second.
